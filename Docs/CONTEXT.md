## 11. Medication Price Calculation & User Flow

### Price Calculation Logic
- **Display Price** for each medication is calculated as:
  - Display Price = Actual Pharmacy Price + (Actual Pharmacy Price Ã 0.10)
  - Example: If Actual Price is $500, Display Price is $550 ($500 + $50 service fee)

### User Flow Instructions
1. **Backend Calculation:**
   - When a pharmacy updates or adds a medication price, the backend automatically calculates the display price by adding a 10% service fee to the actual price.
   - The display price is stored and sent to the frontend for user display.

2. **Pharmacy Card Display:**
   - When a customer searches for medications, each pharmacy card shows:
     - Medication name and dosage
     - Display price (bold, prominent)

3. **Multiple Medications:**
   - For orders with multiple medications, the app displays:
     - Each medication with its display price
     - Grand total (sum of all display prices)

4. **Price Updates:**
   - If a pharmacy changes the actual price after a scan, the display price is recalculated automatically.

5. **Validation:**
   - The system verifies that Display Price = Actual Price Ã 1.1 (tolerance Â±$0.01)
   - If there is a discrepancy, just correct the price before order placement.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If a medication is out of stock from every pharmacy inventories in the system, the card is grayed out and marked "Out of stock".

### Key UI Components: Pharmacy Card

**Pharmacy Information (Top Section):**
- Pharmacy logo (left-aligned)
- Pharmacy name in bold (e.g., HealthyLife Pharmacy)
- Full address in smaller font (single line)

**Medication List (Middle Section):**
- Bulleted list (â«) of medications
- Each line shows:
  - Medication name + dosage (left-aligned)
  - Display price (right-aligned)
  - Format: â« [Medication] [Dosage] [Price]

**Action Button (Bottom):**
- "SELECT PHARMACY" primary button
- Full-width, contrasting color
